This document keeps the answers for I9 to I10 only
There are 10765, which is based on what TA told me, one-to-one entries
There are 6852, which is based on the defination of one-to-one in Math, one-to-one entries
There are 3380 one-to-many entries. 
In general, one-to-many does not mean one is equivalent to many. One-to-many can also mean one is equivalent to the combination of many.
In addition, the combination of many means every element in those entries represents a partial explaination to the one. 
There are 422 no mapping entries. 
9->10 is more feasible because the I9 has less number of no mapping entries than I10, which means I10 lose much more information than I9 does
